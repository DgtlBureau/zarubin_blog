Бюро Цифровых Технологий выступает за преобразующую силу геймификации в программах лояльности. Привлечь и удержать внимание людей можно с помощью трёх стратегических столпов, которые играют важную роль для глубокого взаимодействия. Они выглядят следующим образом:

## Best practices research

You are being presented with a study aimed at exploring best practices for sports brands to achieve their goals.

Throughout the research, you will be shown objectives, metrics, and opportunities for your clients. With the proper use of these features, you will gain opportunities to engage your audience and increase both monetization and engagement.

## Goals and Objectives

## COMMERCE. Ticket Refund Insurance

There is a longstanding tradition of reselling tickets around the secondary ticket market, which can negatively impact buyers. Therefore, Allianz Arena implemented the ability to buy back tickets simply by insuring them for a small fee.

## Online Gift Сards

Gift cards have become very popular among consumers. They provide the club with deferred revenue that may not be redeemed by the user. They also harness the full power of a referral program, further strengthening the relationship between the gifter and the club.

A brand always competes with other brands, and podcasts are what set you apart nowadays. Even if it's not in the top Spotify charts, make sure it has interesting guests and lots of insights.
